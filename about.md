About
===

Hey, I'm William Granados!

I'm a student pursuing a bachelors of science at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in the following: competitive programming, anime/manga, pokemon, video games and memes [javarap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-Cr0EWwaTk). If you see me feel free to bring up any of these topics and I'll likely engage in a discussion.

Below is a picture of me and my sister
