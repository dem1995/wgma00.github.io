Ever since the release of Pokemon ORAS (6th generation) I have seen the meta game evolve in an unexpected way. This once intellectually stimulating game has fallen from grace and has turned into a meta-game where everyone has decided that their main proprity is to status your Pokemon. This mentality has caused many players in my opinion to make brain dead plays/decisions in battle since there are no repercussions for doing so. But before I elaborate on this point, how about we take a walk down memory lane and see how the previous generations led up to the current one.

The DPT (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum) meta-game was the 4th installment(generation) of the Pokemon franchise, and was the first installment where there was a prominent online community for the competive Pokemon. In the DPT meta-game OU was arguably the most balanced, unfortunately the variety then was scarce since there were a limited amount of Pokemon. In this meta-game everything had a check/counter (unless someone got really lucky with machamp), and all of the play styles (balanced, hyper offense, stall) were viable. This meta-game promoted critical thinking when playing opponents as you had to predict what were the options your oponnent had to take in order to win. Also note that in this generation status moves like thunder wave were not as prominent.This made for a very enjoyable meta-game where the winner of a battle was primarily decided on skill and not luck (unless you were running machamp).

After this came the black and white (5th generation) OU meta-game where the tier revolved around the following Pokemon: Ninetails, Politoad, Hippowdon, Abomasnow, and Tyranitar. These Pokemon all had one the following abilities: Drought (Sun), Drizzle(Rain), Sandstream(Sand), and Snow Warning(Hail). These weather conditions almost always hindered  your opponents Pokemon and gave outmatched benefits to a your own team if your team was built well. The most common abusers of these weather condition were Volcarona(Sun/Rain), Keldeo(Rain), Excadrill(Sand), Kyurem-black(Hail). From this list of abusers the most common were Volcarona and Keldeo, who under the effects of weather could manage to OHKO or 2HKO almost all opposing Pokemon. Volcarona had its immensely powerful 120 BP fire blast under the sun (essentially 180 BP) and Keldeo had its immensely powerful 120 BP hydro pump and utility 80 BP scald (essentially 180BP and 120BP, and scald had a 30% change to inflict burn status). Now a new comer may wonder why was this so instrumental to the meta-game. The simple answer is that in this generation weather turns were endless, meaning that these abusers could run rampant through unprepared teams with relative ease. So in a meta-game with one overly powerful play-style(weather) the meta-game soon became dull and repetitive as the same abusers were seen on almost every team. Hence the 5th generation received its notorious label as "Gen 5: Weather Wars".

I believe it's also important to point out that a very game changing move called Scald was introduced in this generation. This move has a 80BP power and has the secondary affect to status your opponent with burn(-50% atk, 12.5% hp per turn).  This was pretty game changing since most physical attackers had to be much more careful when facing a water type as they may risk getting burned and becoming absolutely useless.  Hence, the beginning of the RNG based tactics.

Pokemon XY/ORAS (6th generation) brought with it a slew of new game mechanics.  These include: move adjustments, typing adjustments, critical hit mechanics, weather mechanics, and the most gaming changing: mega evolution. Even though several move adjustments were made I believe the most influential is arguably the knock off boost which powered it up from 20BP to 65BP. This in tandem with its new secondary effect which gives it a 50% boost if the opponent is holding an item makes it a 97.5 BP move. But it doesn't stop there, this move becomes even more frightening due to the typing changes introduced. Specifically dark and ghost types moves were changed to be neutral against steel types. These changes when combined made the move knock off a low risk, high reward move since it has very little resistances, hits hard, and removes your opponent's item.Dark type Pokemon like Bisharp have taken great advantage of these changes and have become some of the most defining pokemon in the meta-game.  In contrast the new fairy types managed to tame the offensive presence of certain pokemon (dragon types). This new typing also breathed new life into Pokemon like Clefable, Mawile, and Azumarill which gained impressive offensive and defensive capabilities.

Critical hits (biggest momentum changer in a game) - received a buff since they occur more frequently now (15% chance instead of 7.5% chance) at only a minimal cost of a 1.5x boost instead of a 2.0x boost; there is no real draw back to this since most of the time all you need is a 1.5x boost to kill off an opponent considering how strong Pokemon are nowadays (I'm looking at you megas).  

Now all these changes weren't for the worst. In this generation weather was nerfed and now only lasts 5 turns instead of lasting indefinitely. This had had a tremendous impact on the meta-game since the representation of weather teams has become scarce. This changed allowed a more diverse array of teams to enter the meta-game. 

 It is finally time for the bitter sweet of the game mechanics, mega evolution. Mega evolution is great in the fact that it gave old Pokemona fresh start and in most cases made them a lot more viable in a certain aspect (offense or defense). But what I dislike about mega evolution is the fact that it made several Pokemon too fast, too strong, too bulky, and generally into mindless sweepers. This change resulted in an over-centralizing meta-game where it is almost mandatory to run your own mega or cripple the opponent's mega in some manner.

Now the time has come for my opinion on the current state of the Pokemon meta-game, specifically OU. But firsts lets step back and look of the state of the past meta-games. In the 4th generation the meta-game was balanced, fun, and thought provoking but was somewhat stale since there were limited Pokemon from which to create a unique team. The 5th generation adopted the mentality of fighting broken with broken, and consisted of many high stakes match where one single mistake could cost you the whole game. Both of these meta-games were quite enjoyable, albeit both being quite stale due to variety. Then came the 6th generation, a meta-game so diverse that the chances of you having the same team as your opponent is practically 0. In this meta-game there are so many viable Pokemon that most matches are highly decided on team match-up since every mega evolution can tear a whole through an unprepared team with little ease. So how do we counter the new fast and strong mega evolutions the meta-game? By running your own mega of course! But wait there's one more thing that almost every player has opted to start running. Yup you guessed it, thunder wave. Since the meta-game is filled with so many fast and strong Pokemon, it's impossible to have a universal check too majority of them the only solution is to rely on thunder wave which offers speed control and complete paralysis.

Overall the meta-game has come along way. We can see that it has had its ups and downs and every generation had a small issue be it from variety to broken game mechanics. But, we can also see that the game has become more reliant on RNG based mechanics to deal with threat, this displeases me since I often see players simply going for these RNG based tactics since they have no repercussions. However what's most infuriating is that sometimes players even choose these tactics over making plays that could win them the game. I can only hope that for Gen 7 thunder wave will not be as prevelant.
