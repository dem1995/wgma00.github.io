title: Welcome! (first blog)
---

Welcome to my blog! I have recently decided to port over my blog from wgma00.ca
to this site wgma00.me. Currently this site is using the Jelkyll platform which
allows me to make blogs using markdown and html. Hopefully this blog will be
more active than my last.

And to kick things here is one of my favourite xkbcd comics. It lives up to the
constant banter I have with my friends about what a real programmer should be
doing :^)

(Real progammers use VIM)
