                <p>Ever since the release of Pokemon ORAS (6th generation) I have seen the meta game evolve in an unexpected way. This once intellectually challenging game has fallen from grace and has turned into a meta-game where everyone runs thunder wave on their Pokemon and have opted to make brain dead plays in order to get an advantage over their opponents. But before I go more in depth in this lets look back at the previous generations that led up to this current generation.</p>

<p>The DPT (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum) meta-game was the 4th generation of Pokemon in the franchise and was the first game where there was a noticeable competitive scene. In the DPT meta-game OU was arguably the most balanced, unfortunately the variety then was scarce since there were a limited amount of Pokemon. In this meta-game everything had a check/counter (unless someone got really lucky with machamp), and all of the play styles (balanced, hyper offense, stall) were viable. This meta-game promoted critical thinking when playing opponents as you had to progressively weaken your opponents defense preparing for a sweep, while at the same time being conservative and stopping any future sweeps from your opponent. This made for a very enjoyable meta-game where thewinner of a battle was primarily decided on skill and not luck(okay some team matchup).</p>

<p><img src="/images/dialga-palkia-giratina.jpg" alt="Palkia(left), Giratina(middle), Dialgoa(Right)" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>After this came the black and white (5th generation) OU meta-game where the tier revolved around the following Pokemon: Ninetails, Politoad, Hippowdon, Abomasnow, and Tyranitar. These Pokemon all had one the following abilities: Drought (Sun), Drizzle(Rain), Sandstream(Sand), and Snow Warning(Hail). These weather conditions almost always resulted in hindering the opponents Pokemon and gave outmatched benefits to a players team if the team was built well. The most common abusers of these weather condition were Volcarona(Sun), Keldeo(Rain), Excadrill(Sand), Kyurem-black(Hail). From this list of abusers the most prominent were Volcarona and Keldeo, who under the effects of weather could manage to OHKO or 2HKO all opposing Pokemon. Volcarona had its immensely powerful 120 BP fire blast under the sun (essentially 180 BP) and Keldeo had its immensely powerful 120 BP hydro pump and utility 80 BP scald (essentially 180BP and 120BP, and scald had a 30% change to inflict burn status). Now you may ask why was this so instrumental to the meta-game? In this generation weather turns were endless, meaning that these abusers could run rampant through unprepared teams with relative ease. So in a game with one overly powerful play-style the meta-game soon became dull and repetitive as the same abusers were seen on almost every team. Hence the 5th generation was labeled the generation of weather wars.</p>

<p>Pokemon XY/ORAS (6th generation) brought with it a slew of new game mechanics.  These include: move adjustments, typing adjustments, critical hit mechanics, weather mechanics, and last but not least mega evolution. Even thought several move adjustments of varying importance were made I believe the most influential is arguably the knock off boost which powered it up from 20BP to 65BP and with its new secondary effect which gave it a 50% boost if the opponent was holding an item (essentially 97.5 BP). This change made a once niche move into one of the most spam-able moves in the game (next to scald). Since the typing adjustments on steel types dark and ghost types have had a greater offensive presence, this made old generations threats like Gengar and Bisharp a lot more lethal to battles. In contrast the new fairy types managed to tame the offensive presence of dragon types while at the same time. Unfortunately this came at the cost of giving a new offensive presence and defensive presence to existing Pokemon like Clefable and Azumarill. And to add on this unfortunate event - critical hits (biggest momentum changer in a game) - received a buff since they occur more frequently now (15% chance instead of 7.5% chance) at only a minimal cost of a 1.5x boost instead of a 2.0x boost; there is no real draw back to this since most of the time all you need is a 1.5x boost to kill off an opponent considering how strong Pokemon are nowadays (looking at you megas). Now to break my streak of pessimism weather now lasts 5 turns instead of lasting indefinitely. This had had a great impact on the meta-game since the representation of weather teams has become scarce, thus allowing diversity into the game. It is finally time for the bitter sweet of the game mechanics, mega evolution. Mega evolution is great in the fact that it gave old Pokemona fresh start and in most cases made them a lot more viable in a certain aspect (offense or defense). But what I dislike about mega evolution is the fact that it made several Pokemon too fast, too strong, too bulky, and generally into mindless sweepers. This change resulted in an over-centralizing meta-game where it is almost mandatory to run your own mega or cripple the opponent’s mega in some manner.</p>

<p><img src="/images/megas.png" alt="Picture of all the mega evolutions" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Now the time has come for my opinion on the current state of the Pokemon meta-game, specifically OU. But firsts lets step back and look of the state of the past meta-games. In the 4th generation the meta-game was balanced, fun, and thought provoking but was a little stale since there were a limited amount of Pokemon. The 5th generation adopted the mentality of fighting broken with broken, and consisted of many high stakes match where one single mistake could cost you the whole game. Both of thesemeta-games were quite enjoyable, albeit both being quite stale due to variety. Then came the 6th generation, a meta-game so diverse that the chances of you having the same team as your opponent is practically 0. In this meta-game there are so many viable Pokemon that most matches are highly are decided on team match-up since every mega evolution can tear a whole through an unprepared team with little ease. So how do we counter the new fast and strong mega evolutions the meta-game? By running your own mega of course! But wait there’s one more thing that almost every player has opted to start running. Yup you guessed it, thunder wave. Since the meta-game is filled with so many fast and strong Pokemon where there it’s impossible to have a universal check too majority of them the only solution is to rely on thunder wave which offers speed control and complete paralysis. So the meta-game has come along way, first it was seen as a utopia of intellectually and fulling battles in generation 4 to a frustrating game where the only way to protect yourself against all of the fast threats is to rely on paralysis and RNG based tactics.</p>
